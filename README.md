# Battleship
**This game will most likeley run ONLY on Linux because of termios.h**

A repository for all the files in my school assignment to make a simple battleship game with a matrix, i added *quite a lot* of extra things to the original assignment such as:
- (planned) local multiplayer
- (considering) network and serial multiplayer
- player vs computer
- WASD input instead of some lame X,Y
- a *fancy* UI (for my standards at least)
- shitty unreadable code

If you add any (serious) issues i *might* fix them, also consider that i'm actively developing this project and it's not yet complete.
